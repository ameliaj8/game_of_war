# game_of_war

## Assumptions
- Rules implemented mostly from this description http://www.pagat.com/war/war.html
- When a player doesn't have enough cards to complete the war their remaining cards (if any) go to the card pile and they are out of the game
- All players participate in a war even if they did not have the highest card
- When a player wins a war the cards are added to the bottom of their pile and not shuffled
